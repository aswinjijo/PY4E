# PY4E
The programs that are created during PY4E course by Dr. Chuck

Welcome to the Python for Everybody (PY4E) course repository! This repository contains a collection of Python programs created as part of the course curriculum developed by Dr. Charles Severance, commonly known as Dr. Chuck. The PY4E course is designed to introduce programming and software development through hands-on coding exercises and real-world examples, making it accessible for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

Programs Included
1. Hello World
The classic first program to get started with Python. It introduces basic syntax and the print function.

2. Conditional Execution
Programs that explore conditional statements, including if, elif, and else clauses. These exercises teach decision-making processes in coding.

3. Loops and Iterations
A series of programs that delve into for and while loops, demonstrating how to iterate over data and automate repetitive tasks.

4. Functions
Exercises focused on defining and calling functions, parameter passing, and return values. These programs illustrate how to modularize code for better readability and reuse.

5. Data Structures
Programs that work with lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. These exercises show how to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently.

6. File Handling
Programs that read from and write to files, teaching essential skills for data processing and persistent storage.

7. Web Scraping
A collection of scripts that use libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape data from websites. These programs demonstrate how to extract and process information from the web.

8. Databases
Programs that interact with databases using SQL and Python's sqlite3 library. These exercises cover database creation, data insertion, querying, and management.

9. Data Visualization
Scripts that generate visual representations of data using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. These programs highlight the importance of visualizing data to uncover patterns and insights.

Getting Started
To get started with these programs, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website. Once you have Python set up, you can clone this repository and run the programs using the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
